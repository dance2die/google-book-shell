## Commands
### **search**
  - USAGE: `search <book name>` (book name is required).
  - ALIAS: `s`
  - DESCRIPTION: Searches for the book on Google Books.
  - If the name has a space, use a double/single quote around the name.
  - EXAMPLE
  ```bash
  google book search$ search "Grokking Algorithms"
  01: Grokking Algorithms
  02: Grokking Deep Learning
  03: Algorithms For Dummies
  04: Algorithms Unlocked
  05: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
  06: Essential Algorithms
  07: The Algorithm Design Manual
  08: The CS Detective
  09: Algorithmic Puzzles
  10: Python Algorithms
  ```
### **open**
  - USAGE: `open [options] <number>` (number is required).
  - ALIAS: `o`
  - DESCRIPTION: Opens the searched book by the search result order in a *web browser*.
  - *NOTE*: Works only after **search** is run.
  - OPTIONS:

  ```bash
  Options:
      --help                        output usage information
      -a, --amazon                  open Amazon link
      -s, --strip-amazon-affiliate  strip affiliate query parameter
  ```
  - `--amazon` (or `-a` for short): Opens Amazon Web Link with affiliate info
      - Amazon's Product API requires a developer to sign up as an affiliate so this was unavoidable.
      - So I added the following option (`-s`) to strip out affiliate info if you choose to do so
      - This flag calls an Azure Function, which needs to wake up after some inactivity (Takes about 10~30 seconds). It will work faster after the first call.
      [![Example](https://i.imgur.com/7CnFDfe.gif)](https://youtu.be/htMZAkHSM94)
  - `--strip-amazon-affiliate` (or `-s` for short): Strip out affiliate info (Please support me by not using this flag üëº)
  - e.g.) 
      - `open 1`
      - `open -a 1` (or `open --amazon 1`)
      - `open -a -s 1` (or `open --amazon --strip-amazon-affiliate 1`)
      - YouTube walk-through

  - USAGE: `view [number]` (number is optional).
  - ALIAS: `v`
  - DESCRIPTION: Displays the description of the searched book in *console* by search result order.
  - When `[number]` argument is missing, it will let user choose a book to view detail for
