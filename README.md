    open <number>      open # in searched book list
    view <number>      view detailed description of the book
    print              print searched books
```

## Commands
1. **search**: `search <book name>` (book name is required).
    - Description: Searches for the book on Google Books.
    - If the name has a space, use a double/single quote around the name.
    - Example
    ```bash
    google book search$ search "Grokking Algorithms"
    01: Grokking Algorithms
    02: Grokking Deep Learning
    03: Algorithms For Dummies
    04: Algorithms Unlocked
    05: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
    06: Essential Algorithms
    07: The Algorithm Design Manual
    08: The CS Detective
    09: Algorithmic Puzzles
    10: Python Algorithms
    ```
2. **open**: `open [options] <number>` (number is required).
    - Description: Opens the searched book by the search result order in a *web browser*.
    - *NOTE*: Works only after **search** is run.
    - Options:
    ```bash
    Options:
        --help                        output usage information
        -a, --amazon                  open Amazon link
        -s, --strip-amazon-affiliate  strip affiliate query parameter
    ```
    - `--amazon` (or `-a` for short): Opens Amazon Web Link with affiliate info
        - Amazon's Product API requires a developer to sign up as an affiliate so this was unavoidable.
        - So I added the following option (`-s`) to strip out affiliate info if you choose to do so
    - `--strip-amazon-affiliate` (or `-s` for short): Strip out affiliate info (Please support me by not using this flag ðŸ‘¼)
    - e.g.) 
        - `open 1`
        - `open -a 1` (or `open --amazon 1`)
        - `open -a -s 1` (or `open --amazon --strip-amazon-affiliate 1`)
        - YouTube walk-through

3. **view**: `view [number]` (number is optional).
    - Description: Displays the description of the searched book in *console* by search result order.
    - When `[number]` argument is missing, it will let user choose a book to view detail for
    - *NOTE*: Works only after **search** is run.
    - Example **with** `[number]` argument.

    - Example **withOUT** `[number]` argument.

    01: Grokking Algorithms
